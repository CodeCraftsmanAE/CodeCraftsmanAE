- ⚡ Fun story:  
  <em>In the technical challenge that secured my first position at a software company, I encountered a set of challenging algorithm problems.  
  One particular problem stood out, it left most developers scratching their heads (including me), then I opted for a unique approach, instead of diving into complex algorithms,  
  I took an unxpected turn and used a series of 'if-else' statements, so it was something like this :  
```java
  if (inputValue == 1) {  
            return 5;  
        } else if (inputValue == 2) {  
            return 10;  
        } else if (inputValue == 3) {  
            return 15;  
            .
            .
            .   
        } else {
            return -1; // Default case if input doesn't match any condition  
        }
```
  
Surprisingly, this 'outside-the-box' approach, with a complexity of O(1) (no loops involved), passed half the test cases.  
The hiring expert found it to be a refreshing display of problem-solving and a good laugh, and I got the position! </em>
